Random C++ snippets
===================

I'm pushing here little bits of code that don't fit elsewhere.

* LRU.cpp

  Least recently used template class list. Originally created to work as a cache system.

If you're reading this and find something that should be fixed let me know. Also my folders are not that organized so I might not be pushing the latest or even working versions. I'll check on that eventually.
